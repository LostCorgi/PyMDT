# NT-MDT Python library

## What is it ?
This library is a tentative to read the *.mdt files generated by [Nova-PX](http://www.ntmdt-si.com/automated-afm/atomic-force-microscope-next) software used but the NT-MDT AFM/MFM/Raman instrument. However, for the moment it is really in an alpha state.


##### Right now it can :
 - read the header of the file
 - read the header of any standard frame
 - (experimental) read the text frame
 - read the _MDA_ frame 
    - 2 dimensions, 1 mesurand the AFM/MFM frame (2D/color map)
    - 1 dimension, 1 mesurand (or 2 mesurands) curve, except if the x axis is store in the XML metadata (in this case put an arbitrary x axis)

##### Next I will add :
 - a nice package with \_\_init__.py and stuff like that -- *low priority*
 - support of the STM frames (MDT_FRAME_SCANNED) 
 - maybe support of the new curve frame MDT_FRAME_CURVES_NEW (but I don't have any file to work with)
 - put a doc and some examples
 
##### I will most likely not add
 - support for the palette frame (I don't know the specs and I clearly don't want spending time on something that nobody use...)
 - support the old 1D _MDA_ curve where the x-coordinates are hide in the XML metatdata (come on, why somebody would hide data information in the metadata)
 - the old _MDA_ format

##### I will not add
 - support for old mda frame : I don't have the specification, and it is not really used anymore.
