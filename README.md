# NT-MDT Python library

## What is it ?
This library is a tentative to read the *.mdt files generated by [Nova-PX](http://www.ntmdt-si.com/automated-afm/atomic-force-microscope-next) software used but the NT-MDT AFM/MFM/Raman instrument. However, for the moment it is really in an alpha state.


##### Right now it can :
 - read the header of the file
 - read the header of any standard frame
 - (experimental) read the text frame
 - read the MDA frame 
    - 2 dimensions, 1 mesurand the AFM/MFM frame
    - 1 dimension, 1 mesurand the raman spectra (new generation)

##### Next I will add :
 - support for the MDA frame (the AFM topology and phase frame)  -- *high priority*
 - support for the curve frame -- *high priority*
 - a nice package with \_\_init__.py and stuff like that -- *low priority*
 - support for the XML metadata of the frame -- *medium priority*

##### I will most likely not add
 - support for the palette frame (I don't know the specs and I cleary don't want spending time for something than nobody use...)

#### I will not add
 - support for old mda frame : I don't have the specification, and it is not really used anymore.
